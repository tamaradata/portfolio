I set variables for the names and prices of a retail catalog. The finished product consists of a total price and item list of customers printed to the output terminal

/*

--Defined merchandise variables and added the first three items--

lovely_loveseat_description = 'tufted polyester blend on wood. 32 inches high x 40 inches wide x 30 inches deep. Red or white.'
lovely_loveseat_price = 254.00
stylish_settee_description = 'stylish settee. Fauz leather on birch. 29.50 inches high x 54.75 inches wide x 28 inches deep. Black'
stylish_settee_price = 180.50
luxurious_lamp_description = 'Luxurious Lamp. Glass and iron. 36 inches tall. Brown with cream shade.'
luxurious_lamp_price = 52.15

--Defined variable for sales tax--

sales_tax = .088

--Defined the variable for the customer to keep a running total of the purchase--

customer_one_total = 0

--Defined variables to track the items purchased--

customer_one_total+= lovely_loveseat_price
customer_one_itemization = ""
customer_one_itemization+=lovely_loveseat_description
customer_one_total += luxurious_lamp_price
customer_one_itemization += luxurious_lamp_description

--Calculated sales tax and total--

customer_one_tax = customer_one_total * sales_tax
customer_one_total+=customer_one_tax

--Added headings and printed receipts--

print('Customer One Items')
print(customer_one_itemization)

print('Customer One Total')
print(customer_one_total)
